There are two project in this dirctory.One is C source code implemented the BitMap File Open and another is coresponding CPP project.
The BmpUtil and the BmpUtilPalette are different in that the former have not save the Palette then used some equal method to simulate this and the latter save the Palette.
In my opinion,the latter is better one.
These code is writen by my senior Yanjian Liu and me.Thxs Mr liu.
